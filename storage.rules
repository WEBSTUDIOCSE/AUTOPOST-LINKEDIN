/**
 * Firebase Storage Security Rules
 *
 * Deploy with: firebase deploy --only storage
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   No client-side file uploads are used in LinkedIn Autoposter.
 *   All media handling (if any) is done server-side via Admin SDK,
 *   which bypasses these rules entirely.
 *
 *   Deny all client reads and writes as a blanket security measure.
 *   Revisit if avatar uploads or image attachments are added.
